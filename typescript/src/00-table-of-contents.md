# Building Production AI Coding Agents from Scratch

A hands-on guide to building a practical CLI coding agent with tool calling, evaluations, context management, OpenAI-compatible providers, and human-in-the-loop safety — all from scratch using TypeScript.

> Inspired by [sivakarasala/building-ai-agents](https://github.com/sivakarasala/building-ai-agents), [Hendrixer/agents-v2](https://github.com/Hendrixer/agents-v2), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/), and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview). This version expands the learning path toward production coding-agent behavior, OpenAI-compatible providers, clearer instructions, bug fixes, and a revamped web experience.

> 💻 **Reference implementation:** the finished TypeScript code is available in [`reference/typescript`](../../reference/typescript). Use it to compare against your own code, debug chapters, or run the completed agent locally.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this book, you'll have a working CLI AI agent that can:

- Read, write, and manage files on your filesystem
- Execute shell commands
- Search the web
- Execute code in multiple languages
- Manage long conversations with automatic context compaction
- Ask for human approval before performing dangerous operations
- Be tested with single-turn and multi-turn evaluations

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** — Type-safe development
- **Vercel AI SDK** — Universal LLM interface with streaming and tool calling
- **OpenAI-compatible provider** — LLM access through a configurable API key, model, and base URL
- **React + Ink** — Terminal UI framework
- **Zod** — Schema validation for tool parameters
- **ShellJS** — Cross-platform shell commands
- **Laminar** — Observability and evaluation framework

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Node.js 20+
- An API key from OpenAI or another OpenAI-compatible provider
- Basic TypeScript/JavaScript knowledge (variables, functions, async/await, imports)
- Comfort running commands in a terminal (`npm install`, `npm run`)

**Not required:**
- Prior experience building CLI tools
- React knowledge (a primer is included in Chapter 9)
- AI/ML background — we explain everything from first principles
- A Laminar API key (optional, for tracking eval results over time)

## Table of Contents

## Part I: Agent Foundations

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to AI Agents](./01-intro-to-agents.md)
What are AI agents? How do they differ from simple chatbots? Set up the project from scratch and make your first LLM call.

### [Chapter 2: Tool Calling](./02-tool-calling.md)
Define tools with Zod schemas and teach your agent to use them. Understand structured function calling and how LLMs decide which tools to invoke.

### [Chapter 3: Single-Turn Evaluations](./03-single-turn-evals.md)
Build an evaluation framework to test whether your agent selects the right tools. Write golden, secondary, and negative test cases.

### [Chapter 4: The Agent Loop](./04-the-agent-loop.md)
Implement the core agent loop — stream responses, detect tool calls, execute them, feed results back, and repeat until the task is done.

### [Chapter 5: Multi-Turn Evaluations](./05-multi-turn-evals.md)
Test full agent conversations with mocked tools. Use LLM-as-judge to score output quality. Evaluate tool ordering and forbidden tool avoidance.

## Part II: Real-World Capabilities

### [Chapter 6: File System Tools](./06-file-system-tools.md)
Add real filesystem tools — read, write, list, and delete files. Handle errors gracefully and give your agent the ability to work with your codebase.

### [Chapter 7: Web Search and Context Management](./07-web-search-context-management.md)
Add web search capabilities. Implement token estimation, context window tracking, and automatic conversation compaction to handle long conversations.

### [Chapter 8: Shell Tool and Code Execution](./08-shell-tool.md)
Give your agent the power to run shell commands. Add a code execution tool that writes to temp files and runs them. Understand the security implications.

### [Chapter 9: Human-in-the-Loop](./09-human-in-the-loop.md)
Build an approval system for dangerous operations. Create a terminal UI with React and Ink that lets users approve or reject tool calls before execution.

## Part III: Hardening the Agent

### [Chapter 10: From Prototype to Product](./10-from-prototype-to-product.md)
What's missing between your learning agent and a serious coding agent. This overview links to focused chapters on reliability, memory, security, tooling, agent planning, and subagents, then closes with a hardening checklist and recommended reading.

### [Chapter 11: Reliability](./11-reliability.md)
Add retries, rate limits, cancellation, and structured logging so failures become visible and recoverable.

### [Chapter 12: Memory](./12-memory.md)
Persist useful conversation and semantic memory without turning every run into a permanent transcript.

### [Chapter 13: Security](./13-security.md)
Scope filesystem access, sandbox shell execution, and defend against prompt injection from tool results.

### [Chapter 14: Tooling and Tests](./14-tooling.md)
Keep tool results bounded, run safe tools in parallel, and test real integrations. Includes a [tool orchestration reference](./14a-tool-orchestration-reference.md).

## Part IV: Agent Architecture

### [Chapter 15: Agent Planning](./15-agent-planning.md)
Add plan/build mode, approval flow, and read-only planning enforcement for more deliberate agent work.

### [Chapter 16: Subagents](./16-subagents.md)
Delegate bounded work to specialized agents, closer to OpenCode and Claude Code's architecture.

## What's Next

This track ends at Chapter 16. Draft chapters for sessions, diff-based editing, permission rules, advanced shell execution, MCP/plugins, provider profiles, context engines, production UI, advanced subagents, and fixture-based evals are held back for a future track.

See the [Roadmap section of the README](../../README.md#roadmap) for what's planned next.

## How to Read This Book

Each chapter builds on the previous one. You'll write every line of code yourself, starting from `npm init` and ending with a fully functional CLI agent.

Code blocks show exactly what to type. When we modify an existing file, we'll show the full updated file so you always have a clear picture of the current state.

By the end, your project will look like this:
